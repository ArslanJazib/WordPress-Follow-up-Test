# WordPress Follow-up Skills Test

This project is a custom WordPress theme built as part of a technical skill test. The test involves converting a PSD design into a fully functional, responsive, and mobile-friendly WordPress theme using core WordPress functionality.

## üß© Project Overview

- The theme is based on **Underscores (_s)** as the starter base.
- The design was provided as a PSD file and manually converted to HTML/CSS with the assistance of AI tools like **ChatGPT**.
- This custom theme includes a homepage template, dynamic settings via Theme Options, and frontend elements including navigation, a top bar, contact form, and footer.

## ‚úçÔ∏è Developer Note

I am primarily a backend WordPress/PHP developer with limited frontend experience. For this test, I generated the HTML and CSS structure using **ChatGPT** to assist with translating the PSD to frontend markup. The goal was to implement and integrate everything correctly into a working WordPress site.

While the final theme does not use `template-parts/` for components, modular template structures can be introduced in future iterations for better scalability and maintainability.
